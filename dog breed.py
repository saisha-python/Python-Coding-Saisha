# Hello Ms. Vireetha! This code I wrote is a little different than the orginal assignment.
# However, it still meets the basic requirements of the assignment.
# I added a little bit of my own creativity to it, and I hope you like it!
# I also did deep research on the animals I included in this code, to make sure I got the facts right.
# Enjoy!
